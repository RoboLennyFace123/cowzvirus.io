Welcome to a world of cowz!
------------------------
Now I bring you CowzVirus 3.0, the final update! 
------------------------
1) Drag the CowzVirus folder onto your desktop
2) Type: echo y | sudo apt-get install festival in terminal
3) Type: echo y | sudo apt-get install xcowsay in terminal to install xcowsay
4) Type: chmod +x /home/user/Desktop/CowzVirus/cowzvirus.sh in terminal
5) Drag the app to your desktop,(It should say Cowz on it and looks like a spring with a pressure plate on top) run it, and enjoy!
------------------------
This virus does not harm the computer in any way, it merely makes cows pop up on the screen.
